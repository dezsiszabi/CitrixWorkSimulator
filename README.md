This program simulates mouse clicks into a running Citrix Workspace window.

The program clicks into the middle of the Citrix Workspace window so make sure nothing important is placed there :)

The program should work even if you have a full-screen application running in the foreground.

The program currently sends a mouse click every second.

Make sure that the Citrix Workspace window is not minimized.

Make sure to run this program after launching the Citrix Workspace session.
